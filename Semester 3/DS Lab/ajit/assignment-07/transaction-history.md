Of course. Here is the step-by-step evolution of the Frequent Pattern Tree (FP-Tree) using your provided dataset.

### \#\# 1. Calculate Item Frequency & Establish Order

First, we scan the dataset to count each item and filter out those that don't meet a minimum support threshold. For this small dataset, we'll set the **minimum support count to 2**.

**Item Counts:**

  * `bread`: 5
  * `milk`: 4
  * `butter`: 4
  * `sugar`: 2
  * `eggs`: 2
  * `coffee`: 1 ❌ (Discarded as its count is less than 2)

Next, we create our master list of frequent items, sorted in descending order of frequency (breaking ties alphabetically). This order is crucial for building the tree.

**Sorted Frequent Items (Header Table Order):**

1.  **`bread`** (5)
2.  **`butter`** (4)
3.  **`milk`** (4)
4.  **`eggs`** (2)
5.  **`sugar`** (2)

### \#\# 2. Building the FP-Tree Transaction by Transaction

The tree starts with a `(root)` node. We now process each transaction by filtering and sorting it according to the list above, then inserting it into the tree.

#### **Transaction 1: `['milk', 'bread', 'butter']`**

  * **Sorted Items:** `['bread', 'butter', 'milk']`
  * **Action:** A new branch is created from the root for this entire path.

<!-- end list -->

```
Tree State:
(root)
└── bread:1
    └── butter:1
        └── milk:1
```

-----

#### **Transaction 2: `['milk', 'bread', 'sugar']`**

  * **Sorted Items:** `['bread', 'milk', 'sugar']`
  * **Action:** The path shares the 'bread' prefix. We increment `bread`'s count to 2 and create a new branch from it for `milk` and `sugar`.

<!-- end list -->

```
Tree State:
(root)
└── bread:2
    ├── butter:1
    │   └── milk:1
    └── milk:1
        └── sugar:1
```

-----

#### **Transaction 3: `['milk', 'butter', 'eggs']`**

  * **Sorted Items:** `['butter', 'milk', 'eggs']`
  * **Action:** This path starts with 'butter', which is not a direct child of the root. A completely new branch is created.

<!-- end list -->

```
Tree State:
(root)
├── bread:2
│   ├── butter:1
│   │   └── milk:1
│   └── milk:1
│       └── sugar:1
└── butter:1
    └── milk:1
        └── eggs:1
```

-----

#### **Transaction 4: `['bread', 'butter', 'eggs']`**

  * **Sorted Items:** `['bread', 'butter', 'eggs']`
  * **Action:** The path shares the prefix `bread` → `butter`. We increment the counts for `bread` (to 3) and `butter` (to 2) and add 'eggs' as a new node.

<!-- end list -->

```
Tree State:
(root)
├── bread:3
│   ├── butter:2
│   │   ├── milk:1
│   │   └── eggs:1
│   └── milk:1
│       └── sugar:1
└── butter:1
    └── milk:1
        └── eggs:1
```

-----

#### **Transaction 5: `['milk', 'bread', 'butter', 'sugar']`**

  * **Sorted Items:** `['bread', 'butter', 'milk', 'sugar']`
  * **Action:** This path shares the prefix `bread` → `butter` → `milk`. We increment the counts for all three nodes and add 'sugar' as a new node at the end.

<!-- end list -->

```
Tree State:
(root)
├── bread:4
│   ├── butter:3
│   │   ├── milk:2
│   │   │   └── sugar:1
│   │   └── eggs:1
│   └── milk:1
│       └── sugar:1
└── butter:1
    └── milk:1
        └── eggs:1
```

-----

#### **Transaction 6: `['bread', 'coffee']`**

  * **Filtered & Sorted Items:** `['bread']` ('coffee' is discarded).
  * **Action:** We only process `bread`. We follow the path to the `bread` node and increment its count to 5.

### \#\# Final FP-Tree Structure 🌳

This is the final, compact FP-Tree after processing all six transactions. Common paths are merged, efficiently storing the frequent pattern information.

```
Final Tree:
(root)
├── bread:5
│   ├── butter:3
│   │   ├── milk:2
│   │   │   └── sugar:1
│   │   └── eggs:1
│   └── milk:1
│       └── sugar:1
└── butter:1
    └── milk:1
        └── eggs:1
```
